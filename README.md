# Why?
This is an educational repository that teaches how to generate random numbers
with various parameter settings using probability distribution functions (PDF) and
probability mass functions (PMF); it also plots the simulated (generated) data
showing the parameters values and the corresponding graphs. Briefly, it

- simulates univariate continuous probability distribution 
- simulates univariate discrete probability distribution 
- simulates bi-variate normal distribution in various sigma values (install 'mvtnorm' package)
- `runifd`,`qunifd`, `punifd` and `dunifd` to support discrete uniform distribution
- plots the data using traditional plot system i.e. `graphics` package

# TODO
- Simulate and plot multinomial and bionomial distributions
- use `persp` for bivariate distributions

# Snapshots
For snapshots see the `png` files.

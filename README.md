# prob-dist-sim

The features of this project are:
- R code to simulate univariate continuous probability distribution 
- R code to simulate univariate discrete probability distribution 
- R code to simulate bi-variate normal distribution in various sigma values (install 'mvtnorm' package)
- Only using R built-in distribution functions
- `runifd`,`qunifd`, `punifd` and `dunifd` to support discrete uniform distribution
- plots are generated using base
- simple but useful

For the output pdf files, checks the release.

# future
- Simulation for multinomial distribution
